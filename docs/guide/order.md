# Order SIMs


## New organisation
Once you have an organisation and account set up with Cube, you may order SIMs directly from regional sales representatives.

## Existing organisation
Once signin, you will be able to see all the SIM assets your organisation already has. For more SIMs, do approach your sales.

If your have more than one organisation, you may also choose to transfer SIMs from one organisation to another, so long you are administrators for both organizaions.


::: tip
Do allow **1-3 working days** before you can view the newly ordered SIMs to **be displayed in your Cube account**.

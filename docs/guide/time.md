# Time

There are two display modes of time zone supported by Cube, UTC0 and the local time. 

Click on the "UTC time" on the top navigation bar next to the organisation tab, to toggle between these two modes.

## UTC Time
When toggled, all date/time elements in cube will be shown in UTC+0 standard time. This ensures consistent time representation across different time zones.


## Local Time
When toggled, all date/time elements in cube will be shown in local time zone.

# Organisation

## Manage Organisation
You may **switch between organisations** from the organisation list in the top navigation bar. Or go to `My Organisations` list to check all the organisations your account is associated with.

You can:
* Check the **basic information** of the organisations, including your roles with them
* Set an organisation as the **default** sign-in organisation
* Edit organisation's **name** if you are an administrator
* **Accept invitation** from a new organisation
* Create an organisation


## Create an Organisation
When you are in `My Organisation` List, click the button `Create organisation`.

Once the basic information is filled up, **you will automatically become the `superadmin` of the new organisation**, and the wizard will then direct you to the oganisation's setting page to invite other collaborators should you choose so.

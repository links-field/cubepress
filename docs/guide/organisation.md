# Organisation

## Manage organisation
You may **switch between organisations** from the organisation list in the top navigation bar. Or go to `My Organisations` list to check all the organisations your account is associated with.

You can:
* Check the **basic information** of the organisations, including your roles with them
* Set an organisation as the **default** sign-in organisation
* Edit organisation's **name** if you are an administrator
* **Accept invitation** from a new organisation
* Create an organisation


## Create an organisation
When you are in `My Organisation` List, click the button `Create organisation`.

Once the basic information is filled up, **you will automatically become the `superadmin` of the new organisation**, and the wizard will then direct you to the oganisation's setting page to invite other collaborators should you choose so. 

::: tip 
Only administrators (`admin` and `superadmin`) can create organisations.

## Delete an organisation
Deletion of an organisation is currently **NOT supported** from Cube. You may reach out to our [support channel](support) and raise your request.


## Switch between organisations

Switch between organisations is rather easy. Go to top navigation bar and select from the panel (next to personal profile icon) which organisation you'd like to go to.

:::tip
If you switch to an organisation with a different role, **the menu will be displayed according to your new permissions**. For example, if you switch from organisation with `admin` role to one with `operator` role, you won't be able to access the `Settings` of that organisation.

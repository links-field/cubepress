# Overage Policy

Overage means the **total data used** has **exceeded** the service bundle limit(quota) set for the SIM in the current cycle. 

The overage policy indicates what action is taken on the SIMs that has data overage.

In the new cycle, the data quota will be **reset**. And the actions triggered by overage policy will be **lifted** should there be any.

## Stop
Data service will come to a complete stop on overage.

## Allowance
Service will only be stopped after the pre-agreed allowance is exceeded on top of the bundle data quota.


## Throttle
Once there is overage, data speed will be throttled to a pre-agreed bandwidth. Common throttling settings are:
* 128 kpbs
* 256 kpbs
* 512 kpbs

## No Limit
**No action** will be taken in this policy as although there is limit set for the cycle, the service contract stipulates the **service should not be disrupted**.

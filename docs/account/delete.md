> in draft

When an account is **no longer needed**, the organisation's administrator can choose to delete the account from the organistaion.

After deletion, the account will no longer have permissions to access organisation's data, such as SIMs and other information. 

**Deletion of the account will NOT delete the audit logs that the account has partipated in.**

::: tip
The deletion only effectively delete the association of the organisation with the account. It does NOT affect the account's permissions with other associated organisations.

::: warning

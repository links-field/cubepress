# Introduction of Account
> in draft


## Basics
Account is the unique credial with Cube.
Cube allows an account to be associated with multiple organisations, with a particular role respectively.


## Roles
As mentioned in [Roles](/guide/roles), only `admin` and `superadmin` can manage the accounts, including other `admin` accounts, but certain properties of `superadmin` are not subject to editing, because **every orgnisation must have 1 superadmin (the defacto owner)** at all times. 


## Management
Administrators can manage organisation's accounts as well as other organisational settings. This chapter mainly describes account management.
